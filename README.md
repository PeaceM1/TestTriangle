# TestTriangle
 
# Deliverable 3
The only challenge I encountered with this assignment was the test cases. The test cases would not register when I ran them. I know for certain there is an issue with my code and am still working on it after submission. My criteria for the test cases was to check to see if it could identify when all the sides were the same and not the same. In addition, I was going to test for when floats were entered instead of integers, but did not get to it due to not being able to get the other two test cases to run.
